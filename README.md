# Python CAN bus monitor

This script allows you to read live data from a CAN bus and display it in an easy-to-read table.

It's meant to be used in conjunction with an Arduino and a CAN bus shield. You'll need this [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/alexandreblin/arduino-can-reader.git) to make it work.

You can also use any serial device capable of reading a CAN bus. It expects data in this format:

    FRAME:ID=X:LEN=Y:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ

where `X` is the CAN frame ID (decimal), `Y` is the number of bytes in the frame, and `ZZ:ZZ...` are the actual bytes (in hex).

## Usage
Install the dependencies (preferably in a virtualenv)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the script

    ./canmonitor.py <serial device> <baud rate>

Press Q at any time to exit the script.

## Example

    ./canmonitor.py /dev/tty.usbmodem1451 115200
